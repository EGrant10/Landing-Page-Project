# Landing Page Project

This here is the personal portfolio landing page assignment for Elijah Grant.
It's purpose is to showcase my projects, unfortunately I am still very early in the game so I don't have any projects to share
but to show my skills with the lesson I went with a Star Wars themed portfolio page.

# How to View

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone
   https://github.com/EGrant10/Landing-Page-Project.git

2. Open 'index.html' in your web browser.

## WHat I Learned

This assignment allowed me to practice essentailly everything I have learned
so far in the HTML and CSS module. I understand better how parent and children elements relate to each other
why also learning how to debug my own code.
